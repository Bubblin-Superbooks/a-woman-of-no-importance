I remember her perfectly.  A silly fair-haired woman with no chin.</p><p>Mrs. Allonby.  Ah, Ernest has a chin.  He has a very strong chin, a square chin.  Ernest’s chin is far too square.</p><p>Lady Stutfield.  But do you really think a man’s chin can be too square?

It is only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all.</p><p>Lady Stutfield.  I adore silent men.</p><p>Mrs. Allonby.  Oh, Ernest isn’t silent.  He talks the whole time.  But he has got no conversation.  What he talks about I don’t know.  I haven’t listened to him for years.</p></div> </div>
