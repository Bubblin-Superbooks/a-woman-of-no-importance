[<em>Waving him back</em>.]  Don’t, don’t!  You cannot love me at all, unless you love her also.  You cannot honour me, unless she’s holier to you.  In her all womanhood is martyred.  Not she alone, but all of us are stricken in her house.</p><p>Gerald.  Hester, Hester, what shall I do?</p><p>Hester.  Do you respect the man who is your father?</p><p>Gerald.  Respect him?  I despise him!  He is infamous.</p><p>Hester.  I thank you for saving me from him last night.</p><p>Gerald.  Ah, that is nothing.  I would die to save you.  But you don’t tell me what to do now!</p><p>Hester.  Have I not thanked you for saving <em>me</em>?</p><p>Gerald.  But what should I do?</p><p>Hester.  Ask your own heart, not mine.  I never had a mother to save, or shame.</p></div> </div>
