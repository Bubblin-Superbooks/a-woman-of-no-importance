Of course I have been quite happy with you.  But a man can’t stay always with his mother.  No chap does.  I want to make myself a position, to do something.  I thought you would have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth’s secretary.</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  I do not think you would be suitable as a private secretary to Lord Illingworth.  You have no qualifications.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Lord Illingworth.  I don’t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs. Arbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am the best judge.  And I can only tell you that your son has all the qualifications I had hoped for.  He has more, in fact, than I had even thought of.  Far more.  [Mrs. Arbuthnot <em>remains silent</em>.]  Have you any other reason, Mrs.</p></div> </div>
