You have always tried to crush my ambition, mother—haven’t you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place, that success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that sort of thing—well, I don’t believe it, mother.  I think the world must be delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a thing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me, mother, quite wrong.  Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a fashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I would give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  I would sooner see you dead.</p><p>Gerald.  Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?  Tell me—tell me right out.  What is it?</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  He is a bad man.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Gerald.  In what way bad?  I don’t understand what</p></div> </div>
