<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.</p><p>Hester.  I didn’t know you had heard it.  But I knew you would agree with me.  A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn’t she?</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Yes.</p><p>Hester.  She shouldn’t be allowed to come into the society of good men and women?</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  She should not.</p><p>Hester.  And the man should be punished in the same way?</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are children, in the same way also?</p><p>Hester.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited on the children.  It is a just law.  It is God’s law.</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  It is one of God’s terrible laws.</p><p>[<em>Moves away to fireplace</em>.]</p></div> </div>
