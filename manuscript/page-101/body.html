<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">talk as you do.  I don’t know how to talk.</p><p>Lord Illingworth.  Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.</p><p>Gerald.  But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?</p><p>Lord Illingworth.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either to feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!</p><p>Gerald.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!</p><p>Lord Illingworth.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it simply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real success in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule society.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You might just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at once.</p></div> </div>
