Yes!</p><p>Lord Illingworth.  I don’t admit for a moment that the boy is right in what he says.  I don’t admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you.  I deny it entirely.

I give you my word of honour.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Mrs. Arbuthnot.  You made that promise to me once</p></div> </div>
