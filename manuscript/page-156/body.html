<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Lord Illingworth.  According to our ridiculous English laws, I can’t legitimise Gerald.  But I can leave him my property.  Illingworth is entailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place.  He can have Ashby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in the north of England, and the house in St. James Square.  What more can a gentleman require in this world?</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Nothing more, I am quite sure.</p><p>Lord Illingworth.  As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in these democratic days.  As George Harford I had everything I wanted.  Now I have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly so pleasant.  Well, my proposal is this.</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  I told you I was not interested, and I beg you to go.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Lord Illingworth.  The boy is to be with you for six months in the year, and with me for the other six.  That</p></div> </div>
