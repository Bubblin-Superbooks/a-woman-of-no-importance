<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Lord Illingworth.  [<em>Sitting down</em>.]  Last night was excessively unfortunate.  That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I wanted to kiss her.  What harm is there in a kiss?</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  [<em>Turning round</em>.]  A kiss may ruin a human life, George Harford.  <em>I</em> know that.  <em>I</em> know that too well.</p><p>Lord Illingworth.  We wonâ€™t discuss that at present.  What is of importance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.  I am extremely fond of him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his conduct last night immensely.  He took up the cudgels for that pretty prude with wonderful promptitude.  He is just what I should have liked a son of mine to be.  Except that no son of mine should ever take the side of the Puritans: that is always an error.  Now, what I propose is this.</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me.</p></div> </div>
