<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">pleased with our boy.  The world will know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be something very near, and very dear.  It is a curious thing, Rachel; my life seemed to be quite complete.  It was not so.  It lacked something, it lacked a son.  I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him.</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of him.  The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.</p><p>Lord Illingworth.  My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over twenty years.  Why not let me have him for a little now?  He is quite as much mine as yours.</p><p>Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Are you talking of the child you abandoned?  Of the child who, as far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of want?</p><p>Lord Illingworth.  You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me.  It was not I who left you.</p></div> </div>
